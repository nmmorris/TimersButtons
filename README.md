## Timers and Buttons: Let's Race!
#### by Scott Kildall



### Overview

This program uses the timer class and the clickable class to race two beanie babies. The beanie babies are assigned random speeds, and when the user clicks the start button, the two race across the screen. The timer keeps track of how long the winner takes to finish and displays it on the screen.


### Technical Details

Uses timer class object, clickable class object, conditional logic to determine winner and control the timer, and draw functions to draw the scene.
